- [Game console](code/game_console): contains a minimal implementation of an in-game console.
- [Animation testing tool](code/animator): can be used to test out animations. Contains a fully featured in-game console with a decoupled and flexible design.

- [Dynamic lighting](code/simple_lighting): contains a small draft implementation for dynamic in-game lighting.
- [Hexagonal grid](code/hexagonal_tiles): contains an implementation of a hexagonal grid, including collision handling.
- [Tidy event queue](code/tidy_event_queue): contains an exercise in decoupling complex pygame event handling constructs into separate parts.
- [Squish and stretch](code/squish_and_stretch): contains an example implementation of squishing and stretching an image.
